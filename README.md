# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle Graphics library. The game allows two players to control paddles and try to score by bouncing a ball past the opponent's paddle. The game ends when one player reaches a score of 2.

## Features
- **Two Player Gameplay:** Players control paddles on the left and right sides using different movement speeds.
- **Ball Movement:** The ball bounces off the paddles and the top/bottom boundaries.
- **Scorekeeping:** Tracks the score for both players.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when one player reaches a score of 2.

## How to Play
- **Player L (Left Side):** Uses paddle on the left side to bounce the ball.
- **Player R (Right Side):** Uses paddle on the right side to bounce the ball.
- **Movement:** The paddles move up and down automatically, but the players can influence the ball's direction by bouncing it off their respective paddles.
- The game ends when either player scores 2 points.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/entromolphya/Pong_game.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```

## Requirements

## Game Flow

2. The ball will start moving automatically and bounce off the top/bottom edges and paddles.
3. Players try to bounce the ball past the opponent's paddle to score points.
